Alerting system for monitoring the passage of payments

This is a project of the alerting system for the passage of payments. According to the concept, the review of alerts takes place for the past period. Therefore, the system builds predictions for the period of real data, but can be modified to set predictive alerting limits for future data.

The model is built to track a target metric (number of successful payments/total number of payments).
